# Sorting_fotos
Small script to seperate good fotos from bad fotos in a super fast and simple workflow

Motivation: After an extensive foto session or a longer holiday there are hundreds or thousands of fotos that have to be edited. Professionals erase the bad ones immediately. But most users prefer to store at least the ones wihich are not perfect but still contain some content that is missing in the "perfect" ones.
There are several apps to classify fotos by giving ratings e.g. 1-5 stars with a mousecklick. But it still takes some effort to destill the really good fotos out of the crowd for further improvement with Photoshop or other apps.

The idea is as follows:
1) User-input to choose a folder where the relevant fotos can be found.
2) User input of two additional folders to which the fotos will be transferred:
    a) folder for good fotos
    b) folder for bad fotos (double, blurred, . . . )
3) Opening the first foto in the folder
4) Options (Wheelmouse):
  a) left mouse click = transfer foto into folder for good ones
  b) scroll wheel = look at previous or next fotos in the folder to compare with the current one
  c) right mouse click = transfer foto into folder for bad ones
5) Close the current foto and show the next one.
6) After the last foto finish the script.

I will try to create some Python code to solve this task. Being a newbie in Python I'll be glad about comments or hints.
